  Java Program 
    I completed this program as an assignment in my Computer Science 2 course. The program takes in a matrix which represents the 
    distances between a varying number of cities, and finds the quickest route to all of the cities. I wrote a branch and bounch method to 
    help make the code quicker. The time complexity of this code was strengthened with that algorithm, and it could still be improved 
    with other similar methods.
